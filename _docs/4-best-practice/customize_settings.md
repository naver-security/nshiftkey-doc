### Configuring NShiftKey setting via security_check.rc

You can configure NShiftKey setting via security_check.rc on root of repository. security_check.rc consists of JSON format and the items are as follows.

> For more detailed examples of case-specific exception handling using the security_check.rc, please refer [here](https://naver.github.io/nshiftkey-doc/4-best-practice/exception_setting/).

> The settings of ExcludeDir, ExcludeFile, and ExcludeCheckRule do not apply to open source vulnerability check.


#### ReportLevel
You can set the security vulnerability level to be reported. The security vulnerability level is set to High, Medium, and Low depending on the severity. (Default: 3)
> ReportLevel will be applied to all check(code security check, sensitive data leakage check, open source vulnerability check, sonarqube - bug, sonarqube - code smell).

1 | Report vulnerabilities with high risk level
2 | Report vulnerabilities with high, medium risk levels
3 | Report vulnerabilities with high, medium, and low risk levels

#### ExcludeDir
You can set up folders to exclude from the report results. If you enter a folder path, all results including the folder path entered in the results will be excluded. (Default: Disable)
> The top of the path is the root of the repository. For example, if you want to exclude src/test from the repository (test1) in the figure below, you must enter src/test, not test1/src/test.
